# Letterboxd API client

This is a simple Ruby script that can access much of the Letterboxd v0 API. 

Please don't treat it as a reference implementation. It was adapted from a very early test harness and is in sore need of tidying up :-)

Although the Letterboxd API isnâ€™t public yet (as at 2017-06-12), we have seeded some developers with API keys. If you're one of the beta testers, please fill in your API_KEY and API_SECRET that were provided to you in ```examples.rb```.

Hope this helps. Comments, pull requests, etc welcome.
